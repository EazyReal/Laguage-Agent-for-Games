You are given a task to write a game agent to interact with a pettingzoo environment.

The environment is defined as follows:
# Prisoner's Dilemma

Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game in game theory where two individuals are arrested, and each must decide whether to cooperate with or betray the other.
The game is played in discrete rounds, and each player chooses between two actions: "COOPERATE" (encoded as 0) or "BETRAY" (encoded as 1)
The rewards are determined based on the joint actions of the players.

### Arguments

```python
prisoners_dilemma.env(max_cycles=15)
```

`max_cycles`:  after max_cycles steps all agents will return done.

### Observation Space
The observation space is a scalar value representing the action of the other player in the previous round.
The space is discrete with 2 possible values:

| Value	| Observation |
| -----	| ----------- |
| 0	    | COOPERATE   |
| 1	    | BETRAY   |

### Action Space
The action space is a scalar value with 2 possible values, representing the player's choice of action:
| Value	| Action |
| -----	| ----------- |
| 0	    | COOPERATE   |
| 1	    | BETRAY   |

The code describe how your agent will interact with the environment:
```python
from pettingzoo.classic import game_name_v0

# create the environment
env = game_name_v0.env()

# create your agent and the opponent agent
agents = {
    env.possible_agents[0]: Agent(env, env.possible_agents[0]),
    env.possible_agents[1]: OpponentAgent(env, env.possible_agents[1])
}

def simulate(agents: any, env: AECEnv) -> dict[any, float]:
    env.reset()
    rewards = {agent: 0 for agent in env.possible_agents}
    
    for agent in agents.values():
        agent.reset()

    for agent_name in env.agent_iter():
        observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
        rewards[agent_name] += reward
        obs_message = agents[agent_name].observe(
            observation, reward, termination, truncation, info
        )
        if termination or truncation:
            action = None
        else:
            action = agents[agent_name].act()
        print(f"Agen {agent_name} Action {action}")
        env.step(action)
    env.close()
    return rewards

simulate(agents, env)
```


Here is a starter code to help you get started with coding the agent class,
you can replace the starter code with your own code and add more methods if needed,
but you should not change the method signatures:
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.
# However, you can add more methods or change the implementations to obtain a better strategy.
class Agent:
    # import the necessary packages here
    import random
    # initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    # reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    # update the agent's state here
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    # return the action here
    # write comments to explain why this is a good policy.
    # this is an example of choosing the action randomly, you may want to change it.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

Now, solve the task with the following steps:
First, think about the problem and write down your thoughts:
- Recap some basic game theory knowledge (Nash equilibrium, best response) and apply it to the problem.
Second, write a new Agent class referencing the starter code to interact with the environment and maximize your reward. 
For the coding part:
- Enclose the code by ```python and ```
- Only write the new Agent class, write comments to explain your reasoning.
- `import` needs to be under the Agent scope. You can only import from the standard library and numpy.

The response format should be:
[Thoughts] <your thoughts>
[Code]
```python
class Agent:
    ... # your code
```
Response: 
[Thoughts]
To maximize the reward in the Prisoner's Dilemma game, the agent should consider the possible actions of the opponent and choose the action that maximizes its own reward. This can be achieved by implementing a strategy that takes into account the previous actions of the opponent and adjusts its own actions accordingly.

One possible strategy is the "Tit-for-Tat" strategy, where the agent initially cooperates and then copies the opponent's previous action in each subsequent round. This strategy is effective in encouraging cooperation from the opponent and avoiding a cycle of betrayals.

Another strategy is the "Random" strategy, where the agent randomly chooses between cooperating and betraying in each round. This strategy introduces uncertainty and can prevent the opponent from exploiting a predictable pattern.

A more advanced strategy is the "Pavlov" strategy, where the agent adjusts its action based on the outcome of the previous round. If the agent and the opponent both cooperated or both betrayed in the previous round, the agent repeats its previous action. If the outcomes were different, the agent switches its action. This strategy can adapt to the opponent's behavior and maximize the agent's reward.

[Code]
```python
class Agent:
    import random

    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def reset(self):
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)

    def act(self):
        if len(self.history["actions"]) == 0:
            action = self.random_action()
        else:
            opponent_action = self.history["observations"][-1]
            action = self.pavlov_strategy(opponent_action)
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

    def random_action(self):
        return self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()

    def pavlov_strategy(self, opponent_action):
        if opponent_action == 0:
            return self.history["actions"][-1]
        else:
            return 1 - self.history["actions"][-1]
```
In this code, the `Agent` class implements the "Pavlov" strategy. The `observe` method stores the opponent's action in the agent's history, and the `act` method uses the Pavlov strategy to determine the agent's action. If the opponent's action is 0 (cooperate), the agent repeats its previous action. If the opponent's action is 1 (betray), the agent switches its action. The `random_action` method is used to randomly choose an action in the first round.

        print(f"Agen {agent_name} Action {action}")
        env.step(action)
    env.close()
    return rewards

simulate(agents, env)
```


You have written the following code to play the game with another agent:
```python

class Agent:
    import random

    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def reset(self):
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)

    def act(self):
        if len(self.history["actions"]) == 0:
            action = self.random_action()
        else:
            opponent_action = self.history["observations"][-1]
            action = self.pavlov_strategy(opponent_action)
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

    def random_action(self):
        return self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()

    def pavlov_strategy(self, opponent_action):
        if opponent_action == 0:
            return self.history["actions"][-1]
        else:
            return 1 - self.history["actions"][-1]

```

And here is the result of your agent playing against another agent:
Your agent is named player_0.
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action 0
player_1 takes action 0
player_0 takes action None
player_1 takes action None


Now, based on your last agent, the rewards it obtained, and the history, write a new Agent class.
First, think about what you have done and what you can do to improve the agent's performance.
- Recap some basic game theory knowledge (Nash equilibrium, best response) and apply it to the situation.
- Think about what the other agent is doing and how you can exploit it.
Second, write a new Agent class to interact with the environment and the agent you interacted with and maximize your reward. 
For the coding part:
- Enclose the code by ```python and ```
- Only write the new Agent class, write comments to explain your reasoning.
- `import` needs to be under the Agent scope. You can only import from the standard library and numpy.

The response format should be:
[Thoughts] <your thoughts>
[Code]
```python
class Agent:
    ... # your code
```
Response: 
[Thoughts]
Based on the previous agent's behavior, it seems that the opponent agent always chooses to cooperate (action 0). This behavior can be exploited by always choosing to betray (action 1) in order to maximize the reward. The new agent will implement this strategy.

[Code]
```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def reset(self):
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)

    def act(self):
        action = 1  # Always choose to betray
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```
