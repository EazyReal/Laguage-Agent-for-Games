You are given a task to write a game agent to interact with a pettingzoo environment.

Here is the some information regarding the environment:

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a 2-player hand game where each player chooses either rock, paper or scissors and reveals their choices simultaneously. If both players make the same choice, then it is a draw. However, if their choices are different, the winner is determined as follows: rock beats
scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

### Arguments

``` python
rps_v2.env(max_cycles=15)
```
`max_cycles`:  after max_cycles steps all agents will return done.

### Observation Space

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors

If 3 actions are required, the game played is the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. The observation is the last opponent action and its space is a scalar value with 4 possible values. Since both players reveal their choices at the same time, the observation is None until both players have acted.
Therefore, 3 represents no action taken yet. Rock is represented with 0, paper with 1 and scissors with 2.

| Value  |  Observation |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |
| 3      | None         |


### Action Space

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors

The action space is a scalar value with 3 possible values. The values are encoded as follows: Rock is 0, paper is 1 and scissors is 2.

| Value  |  Action |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |

### Rewards

| Winner | Loser |
| :----: | :---: |
| +1     | -1    |

If the game ends in a draw, both players will receive a reward of 0.

The code describe how your agent will interact with the environment:
```python
from pettingzoo.classic import game_name_v0

# create the environment
env = game_name_v0.env()

# create your agent and the opponent agent
agents = {
    env.possible_agents[0]: Agent(env, env.possible_agents[0]),
    env.possible_agents[1]: OpponentAgent(env, env.possible_agents[1])
}

def simulate(agents: any, env: AECEnv) -> dict[any, float]:
    env.reset()
    rewards = {agent: 0 for agent in env.possible_agents}
    
    for agent in agents.values():
        agent.reset()

    for agent_name in env.agent_iter():
        observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
        rewards[agent_name] += reward
        obs_message = agents[agent_name].observe(
            observation, reward, termination, truncation, info
        )
        if termination or truncation:
            action = None
        else:
            action = agents[agent_name].act()
        print(f"Agen {agent_name} Action {action}")
        env.step(action)
    env.close()
    return rewards

simulate(agents, env)
```

Here is a starter code to help you get started with coding the agent class,
you can replace the starter code with your own code and add more methods if needed,
but you should not change the method signatures:
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.
# However, you can add more methods or change the implementations to obtain a better strategy.
class Agent:
    # You can initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    # You can reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    # You can update the agent's state
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    # You should return the action you want to take and write a docstring to explain why it is a good action.
    # This is an example of choosing the action randomly.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

Now, write the Agent class to interact with the environment and maximize your reward. 
For each method, you should write comments to describe the method.
For the act() method, you should return the action you want to take and write comments to explain why it is a good action.
Your should only write the Agent class, and the code should be enclosed by ```python and ```.
Response: 
```python
import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    def reset(self):
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    def act(self):
        # Choose a random action
        action = random.randint(0, 2)
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

In this agent class, the `act()` method chooses a random action from the available actions (rock, paper, scissors). Since the opponent's action is not known, choosing a random action is a simple and fair strategy.

        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

In this starter code, the `Agent` class is initialized with the environment and the agent's name. The `reset` method is used to reset the agent's state, and the `observe` method is used to store the observation in the agent's history. 

The `act` method is where the agent chooses its action. In this starter code, a random action is chosen using the `sample` method from the action space. This is a simple strategy that does not take into account the observation or the opponent's actions. 

To improve the agent's strategy, you can modify the `act` method to consider the current observation and the opponent's actions. You can use the agent's history to analyze patterns and make informed decisions. For example, you can implement a strategy that counters the opponent's previous action or predicts the opponent's next action based on their history.

Now, given the starter code, you should write a new Agent class to interact with the environment and maximize your reward. 
For each method, you should write comments to describe the method.
For the act() method, you should return the action you want to take and write comments to explain why it is a good action.
For the code part, you should enclose it by ```python and ``` and only write the Agent clase, all import need to be under the Agent scopr.

        action = self.random.choice([0, 1, 2])
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

In this agent class, the `act()` method chooses a random action from the available actions (rock, paper, scissors). Since the opponent's action is not known, choosing a random action is a simple and fair strategy.

If 3 actions are required, the game played is the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. The observation is the last opponent action and its space is a scalar value with 4 possible values. Since both players reveal their choices at the same time, the observation is None until both players have acted.
Therefore, 3 represents no action taken yet. Rock is represented with 0, paper with 1 and scissors with 2.

| Value  |  Observation |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |
| 3      | None         |


### Action Space

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors

The action space is a scalar value with 3 possible values. The values are encoded as follows: Rock is 0, paper is 1 and scissors is 2.

| Value  |  Action |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |

### Rewards

| Winner | Loser |
| :----: | :---: |
| +1     | -1    |

If the game ends in a draw, both players will receive a reward of 0.

The code describe how your agent will interact with the environment:
```python
from pettingzoo.classic import game_name_v0

# create the environment
env = game_name_v0.env()

# create your agent and the opponent agent
agents = {
    env.possible_agents[0]: Agent(env, env.possible_agents[0]),
    env.possible_agents[1]: OpponentAgent(env, env.possible_agents[1])
}

def simulate(agents: any, env: AECEnv) -> dict[any, float]:
    env.reset()
    rewards = {agent: 0 for agent in env.possible_agents}
    
    for agent in agents.values():
        agent.reset()

    for agent_name in env.agent_iter():
        observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
        rewards[agent_name] += reward
        obs_message = agents[agent_name].observe(
            observation, reward, termination, truncation, info
        )
        if termination or truncation:
            action = None
        else:
            action = agents[agent_name].act()
        print(f"Agen {agent_name} Action {action}")
        env.step(action)
    env.close()
    return rewards

simulate(agents, env)
```

Here is a starter code to help you get started with coding the agent class,
you can replace the starter code with your own code and add more methods if needed,
but you should not change the method signatures:
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.
# However, you can add more methods or change the implementations to obtain a better strategy.
class Agent:
    # import the necessary packages here
    import random
    # initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    # reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    # update the agent's state here
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    # return the action here
    # write comments to explain why this is a good policy.
    # this is an example of choosing the action randomly, you may want to change it.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

Now, given the starter code, you should write a new Agent class to interact with the environment and maximize your reward. 
For each method, you should write comments to describe the method.
For the act() method, you should return the action you want to take and write comments to explain why it is a good action.
For the code part, you should enclose it by ```python and ``` and only write the Agent clase, all import need to be under the Agent scopr.
Response: 
```python
class Agent:
    import random
    
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    def reset(self):
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    def act(self):
        # Choose a random action
        action = self.random.choice([0, 1, 2])
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

In this agent class, the `act()` method chooses a random action from the available actions (rock, paper, scissors). Since the opponent's action is not known, choosing a random action is a simple and fair strategy.

Prompt: 
You are given a task to write a game agent to interact with a pettingzoo environment.

Here is the some information regarding the environment:

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a 2-player hand game where each player chooses either rock, paper or scissors and reveals their choices simultaneously. If both players make the same choice, then it is a draw. However, if their choices are different, the winner is determined as follows: rock beats
scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

### Arguments

``` python
rps_v2.env(max_cycles=15)
```
`max_cycles`:  after max_cycles steps all agents will return done.

### Observation Space

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors

If 3 actions are required, the game played is the standard Rock, Paper, Scissors. The observation is the last opponent action and its space is a scalar value with 4 possible values. Since both players reveal their choices at the same time, the observation is None until both players have acted.
Therefore, 3 represents no action taken yet. Rock is represented with 0, paper with 1 and scissors with 2.

| Value  |  Observation |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |
| 3      | None         |


### Action Space

#### Rock, Paper, Scissors

The action space is a scalar value with 3 possible values. The values are encoded as follows: Rock is 0, paper is 1 and scissors is 2.

| Value  |  Action |
| :----: | :---------:  |
| 0      | Rock         |
| 1      | Paper        |
| 2      | Scissors     |

### Rewards

| Winner | Loser |
| :----: | :---: |
| +1     | -1    |

If the game ends in a draw, both players will receive a reward of 0.

The code describe how your agent will interact with the environment:
```python
from pettingzoo.classic import game_name_v0

# create the environment
env = game_name_v0.env()

# create your agent and the opponent agent
agents = {
    env.possible_agents[0]: Agent(env, env.possible_agents[0]),
    env.possible_agents[1]: OpponentAgent(env, env.possible_agents[1])
}

def simulate(agents: any, env: AECEnv) -> dict[any, float]:
    env.reset()
    rewards = {agent: 0 for agent in env.possible_agents}
    
    for agent in agents.values():
        agent.reset()

    for agent_name in env.agent_iter():
        observation, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
        rewards[agent_name] += reward
        obs_message = agents[agent_name].observe(
            observation, reward, termination, truncation, info
        )
        if termination or truncation:
            action = None
        else:
            action = agents[agent_name].act()
        print(f"Agen {agent_name} Action {action}")
        env.step(action)
    env.close()
    return rewards

simulate(agents, env)
```

Here is a starter code to help you get started with coding the agent class,
you can replace the starter code with your own code and add more methods if needed,
but you should not change the method signatures:
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.

class Agent:
    # import the necessary packages here
    import random
    # initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    # reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    # update the agent's state here
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    # return the action here
    # write comments to explain why this is a good policy.
    # this is an example of choosing the action randomly, you may want to change it.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action

Now, given the starter code, you should write a new Agent class to interact with the environment and maximize your reward. 
For each method, you should write comments to describe the method.
For the act() method, you should return the action you want to take and write comments to explain why it is a good action.
First, think step by step, recap some basic game theory knowledge, and then write your code.
For the code part, you should enclose it by ```python and ``` and only write the Agent class, all `import` need to be under the Agent scope.
Response: 
```python
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.
# However, you can add more methods or change the implementations to obtain a better strategy.
class Agent:
    # import the necessary packages here
    import random
    
    # initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }

    # reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
    
    # update the agent's state here
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
    
    # return the action here
    # write comments to explain why this is a good policy.
    # this is an example of choosing the action randomly, you may want to change it.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        # Choose a random action
        action = self.env.action_space(self.name).sample()
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

To create a better strategy for the Rock Paper Scissors game, we can use the following approach:

1. Keep track of the opponent's previous actions and use that information to make a decision.
2. Analyze the opponent's action history to identify any patterns or tendencies.
3. Exploit any identified patterns or tendencies to make a counter move.
4. If no patterns or tendencies are identified, choose a random action to keep the opponent guessing.

Here is an updated version of the Agent class that implements this strategy:

```python
# This is the starting point of your agent class, you should not change the existing method signatures.
# However, you can add more methods or change the implementations to obtain a better strategy.
class Agent:
    # import the necessary packages here
    import random
    
    # initialize the agent's state here
    def __init__(self, env, name):
        self.env = env
        self.name = name
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
        self.opponent_actions = []
    
    # reset the agent's state here
    def reset(self):
        """
        Reset the agent's state.
        """
        self.history = {
            "observations": [],
            "actions": []
        }
        self.opponent_actions = []
    
    # update the agent's state here
    # This is an example of storing the observation.
    def observe(self, observation, reward, termination, truncation, info):
        self.history["observations"].append(observation)
        if self.name != self.env.possible_agents[0]:
            self.opponent_actions.append(observation)
    
    # return the action here
    # write comments to explain why this is a good policy.
    # this is an example of choosing the action randomly, you may want to change it.
    # self.env.action_space is a method, not a subscriptable object.
    def act(self):
        # Check if there are enough opponent actions to analyze
        if len(self.opponent_actions) >= 2:
            # Get the opponent's last two actions
            last_action = self.opponent_actions[-1]
            second_last_action = self.opponent_actions[-2]
            
            # Check if the opponent has a pattern of choosing the same action
            if last_action == second_last_action:
                # Counter the opponent's action
                if last_action == 0:  # Opponent chose Rock
                    action = 1  # Choose Paper
                elif last_action == 1:  # Opponent chose Paper
                    action = 2  # Choose Scissors
                else:  # Opponent chose Scissors
                    action = 0  # Choose Rock
            else:
                # No pattern identified, choose a random action
                action = self.random.choice([0, 1, 2])
        else:
            # Not enough opponent actions to analyze, choose a random action
            action = self.random.choice([0, 1, 2])
        
        self.history["actions"].append(action)
        return action
```

In this updated version, the agent keeps track of the opponent's previous actions in the `opponent_actions` list. It then analyzes the opponent's action history to identify any patterns or tendencies. If a pattern is identified, the agent chooses a counter move. If no pattern is identified, the agent chooses a random action.
